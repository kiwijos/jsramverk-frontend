## Description
This is the frontend part of our web application. Here we will focus on the choices made, challenges encountered and solutions implemented in the frontend only. To get the full picture of our work in this course, please have a look in the repository of the backend part of our application.

## Getting the application to run
### Fixing vulnerabilities
Before running the npm audit tool we had to create a lockfile and npm package. When running the audit tool, no vulnerabilities were found. Which came as no surprise as the application was not depending on any external modules. For more information about vulnerabilities, please see the README in the repository of the backend part of our application.

## Frontend framework
We chose Vue as our frontend JavaScript framework. It's a well-established framework that boasts both a gentle learning curve and impressive performance. We are a team of two people, one with no previous experience of working with any JavaScript framework who's looking for something approachable. The other has all the more experience and sees Vue as a relevant technology in the industry, although, he's never used it himself. With this choice of framework, we hope to bridge the gap between our differing experience levels and collaborate smoothly while also acquiring a skill that is in demand.
